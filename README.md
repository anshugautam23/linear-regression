# ðŸ“Š Linear Regression Example in Python

This is a simple Python program demonstrating **Linear Regression** using `scikit-learn`.  
It trains a model on a small dataset and plots the regression line.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Uses `scikit-learn`'s `LinearRegression` model.
- Trains with sample data (hours studied vs. marks scored).
- Prints slope, intercept, and predictions.
- Plots data points and regression line using `matplotlib`.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, then install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
